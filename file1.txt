This is my first git command
======================================================================
This is just a change - I have added one more line to the existing file
Just trying to get familiar with git
echo "This is the first line of the file 'just trying to add more file'
This is another change - I have added another line
This is the second line that i'm trying to add to the file 'file1.txt'
I am now working on this file
Adding another line to modify the change

Yes, I have fetched the file from Github project repository
Also, I have worked on this file, tested it and going to push it back to the Github repository
Just deleted a line to prove a point.
